# Svg trials for graphs

## Circle graph 

* So circle graph is a type of graph that can be used instead of a pie chart to show 3 dimensional data.

    *  dim1 - Rent for houses - x axis [min-rent, max-rent]
    * dim3 - Square feet of the house. - radius of the circle. [rent-amount, distance-from-bart, circ-redis]
    * dim5 - distance to the bart station < 5mi - y axis [min-dist, max-dist]
    * dim2 - Is it pet friendly? - checkbox to enable or disable.
    * dim4 - Parking availability - checkbox to enable or disable
    * dim6 - distance to location X < 5mi - checkbox to enable or disable.

## Use div's to acheive this and move some of the stuff to css.
